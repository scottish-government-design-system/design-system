## Configuration options

The text colour of the side navigation’s open/close toggle (only visible on small displays) can be overridden. It defaults to the primary brand colour.

```$side-nav__expand-color```

Your value for this should be included before you include the SCSS file.

```scss
$side-nav__expand-color: red;
@import '/path/to/components/side-navigation/side-navigation';
```
