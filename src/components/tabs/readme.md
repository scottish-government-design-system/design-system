## Types of tab

There are two distinct types of tab that share a common visual style at larger viewport widths:

- **Dynamic tabs** where the tabs change only the contents of the panel under the tabs
- **Navigation tabs** where the tabs are links to different pages

### Dynamic tabs

Further research is needed on whether including the number of items within each tab as part of the tab labels is understood by users.

### Navigation tabs

Only one set of navigation tabs should be used on a page to help users understand that have changed to a different page.

A set of navigation tabs should be consistently placed on every page they are used.
