## Colour

Cards should use a different colour to the background for increased contrast:

- White cards when on a light grey background
- Grey cards when on a white background

## Icons
The main icon for a card should have no horizontal spacing included in the SVG. This will keep the correct alignment.
If using material icons you can retain any vertical spacing but should remove the horizontal spacing.
